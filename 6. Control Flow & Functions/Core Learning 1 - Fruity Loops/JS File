/*NOTES - i = iteration counter. i = 0 is the start point. i < fruits.length is the check to see if the loop has counted within fruits.length 
which in this case is 8, if it is > fruits.length then the iteration will stop. i++ is to count up until the middle clause is reached 
assuming this is not infinity.*/

fruits[i].toLowerCase formats the string into lower cases which is important for us to compare our vowels_array table which is also in lower 
cases.*/

execute any lines that would have occurred if the condition were met or will return false.*/

returns a true or false for the letters checked through the .includes function which will scan the vowels_array array to find the vowels. If true, 
then "An" will be listed in front of the fruit when printed to the console.*/
