//Step 1 - Ask the user to type in their name

//Step 3 - Display one of eight stored phrases. The below phrases have been stored in an array

    'Not looking too good',
    'Probably',

//Step 4
/*This stage picks a random phrase by knowing how many phrases are 
listed in the array called randomResponses. In this situation 
there are only 8 phrases, this satisfies criteria 3 because it 
picks a random number that corresponds to a specifc phrase in the 
array(0-7).*/
