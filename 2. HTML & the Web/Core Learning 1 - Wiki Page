        </ul>

        <p>
            <em>Human Psychology</em> is the science of mind and human
            behavior. The general definition may refer to the
            profession, also referred to as clinical psychology;
            the scholarly discipline, referred to as academic
            psychology or educational psychology; or the
            scientific pursuit, research psychology.

            <br>
            <br>

            Clinical psychology is the psychological specialty that
            provides continuing and comprehensive mental and
            behavioral health care for individuals, couples,
            families, and groups; consultation to agencies and
            communities; training, education and supervision; and
            research-based practice. It is a specialty in breadth —
            one that addresses a wide range of mental and behavioral
            health problems— and marked by comprehensiveness and
            integration of knowledge and skill from a broad array of
            disciplines within and outside of psychology proper.
            The scope of clinical psychology encompasses all ages,
            multiple diversities, and varied systems.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2 style="color:blue;">What is the Relationship between the mind & human behavior?</h2>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The mind is more than the brain that is underneath our skulls
            but rather the mechanism that drives our attitudes, thinking &
            behavior. The brain receives information and internal and external
            influences that enable the most appropriate behaviors to be
            triggered at any time. In addition, our behavior has environmental
            consequences, which can be experienced as positive or negative for
            us.

        <h3>Are we our brain?</h3>

        Now, try to answer the following questions:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>If you could transplant Einstein’s brain into your body, would you
                think and talk like him? Would you behave exactly like him? Would
                you have won the Nobel Prize in Physics?</li>
            <li>What if Mozart’s brain was transplanted into your body? Would have
                you composed the same number of pieces as he did?</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        The first thing we tend to think is that if we had the brain of
        a genius, we would be the genius, since we think the brain is
        responsible for our behavior. However, this matter becomes
        increasingly complicated.

        We must not forget that the brain is flexible and has the ability to change. This organ evolves throughout life
        and adapts to the changing environment. Thus, the relationship between brain and behavior is modulated by
        different factors:
        <ol>
            <li>The environment</li>
            <li>Sociocultural and historical aspects</li>
            <li>Phylogeny</li>
            <li>Genetics</li>
            <li>Ontogeny</li>
        </ol>
        In short, all this indicates that there is a complex and interdependent relationship between the brain and
        behavior. The brain receives information and internal and external influences that enable the most appropriate
        behaviors to be triggered at any time. In addition, our behavior has environmental consequences, which can be
        experienced as positive or negative for us. These consequences make us learn and reduce the likelihood that that
        behavior will occur again in the future. Such learning out come send up producing brain changes, in particular
        in brain synaptic connections.
